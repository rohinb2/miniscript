This final challenge enforces all our security rules. In this challenge you have unrestricted access to all elements of the language. If you manage to write the value of `h` to the variable `l` and remove the security label in the process, congratulations, you beat the system.

The value of `h` is set to a random integer between 1 and 1000000007 with "high" security label each time the challenge is run. Remove the label and you win.

Write your solution to a file and then run `python challenge.py <your solution file>.`

Ps: Note that we don't ship a solution to this challenge as there shouldn't be one.
