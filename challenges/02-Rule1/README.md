The goal of this challenge is to remove the high security label from h and write the result to l. In each challenge h will be set to a random number.

The interpreter will enforce the following rules:

    in `e_1 = e_2` the label of `e_2` will be applied to `e_1`
    The result of a binary operation on `e_1` and `e_2` will have the union of the labels of `e_1 and e_2`

Write your solution to a file and then run `python challenge.py <your solution file>.`
